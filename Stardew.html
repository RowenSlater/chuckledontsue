	<p>You've inherited your grandfather's old farm plot in Stardew Valley. Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home?
	</p>
	<p>Stardew Valley is a farming simulation game primarily inspired by the Harvest Moon series. At the start of the game, the player creates their character, with them becoming the recipient of a plot of land and a small house, which was once owned by their grandfather, in an area called Stardew Valley. The plot is initially overrun with boulders, trees, and weeds, but the player works to clear the fields and restart the farm, tending to crops and livestock as to generate revenue and which to further expand the farm's buildings and facilities.
	</p>
	<p>Stardew Valley was created entirely by American indie game designer Eric Barone, under the alias of ConcernedApe. In 2011, Barone had graduated from the University of Washington Tacoma with a computer science degree, but had not been able to get a job in the industry, instead working as an usher at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle. Looking to improve his computer skills for better job prospects, he came to the idea of crafting a game which would also pull in his artistic side. Stardew Valley originally began as a modern fan-made alternative to the Harvest Moon series, as he felt that "the series had gotten progressively worse after Harvest Moon: Back to Nature". Unable to find a satisfactory replacement, Barone began to create a game similar to the series, stating that his intent was "to address the problems I had with Harvest Moon" and that "no title in the series ever brought it all together in a perfect way". Barone was also inspired by other games, including Animal Crossing, Rune Factory, Minecraft, and Terraria, adding features seen in those titles such as crafting, quests, and combat.
