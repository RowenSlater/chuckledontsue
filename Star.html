		<p>In Starbound, you take on the role of a character who has just fled from their home planet, only to crash-land on another. From there you will embark on a quest to survive, discover, explore and fight your way across an infinite universe!
		</p>
		<p>Starbound is a video game developed and published by independent game studio Chucklefish Games. Starbound takes place in a two-dimensional, procedurally generated universe which the player will explore in order to obtain new weapons, armour, and miscellaneous items. 
		</p>
		<p>Starbound was formally announced by Tiyuri in February 2012,[12] with a tiered, Kickstarter-style, pre-order opening via the Humble Store on April 13, 2013. Tier options included a copy of the game, an invite to the beta, and a download of the game's soundtrack, as well as game-related "rewards", such as naming an in-game NPC, designing a hat or weapon, and having a statue of oneself designed to be placed in the game. Within 24 hours of the pre-order opening, over 10,000 people backed the game, contributing over $230,000 to fund the game's development. By April 29, 2013, the Starbound pre-order had reached all three of its stretch goals by raising over $1,000,000. The game entered its initial stage of beta and was released on Steam on December 4, 2013, receiving over $2,000,000 in pre-orders prior to its launch.
